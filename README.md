# Rust SteamID parser
Accepts strings and will attempt to parse them as SteamID64, SteamID or SteamID3.
This is my first "real" Rust program, so it's pretty messy all things considered.
# Usage
```sh
> steamid 103582791464489035
Interpreting as SteamID64
steamID64:      103582791464489035
steamID:        STEAM_1:1:17483813
steamID3:       [g:1:34967627]


```
You can enter an arbitrary number of SteamIDs.
